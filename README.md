RC Car Powered by Solar Panels

Project Overview
This project showcases an RC car that is partially powered by solar panels as part of my first-year chemistry course. The integration of solar power with conventional battery power aims to explore the application of renewable energy in practical systems.

Components Used
* RC Car Chassis
* Solar Panels [12V]
* Li-ion Rechargeable Batteries
* Microcontroller: [Arduino Uno]
* L298 Motor Driver Module
* Bluetooth Module HC-05
* DC-DC Converter Module
* Miscellaneous: Wires, connectors, etc.
